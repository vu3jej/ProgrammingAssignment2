## Cache the inverse of a matrix and returns the cache if matrix has not been
## changed

## Creates an 'matrix' object that can cache it's inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Calculates the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix. Retrieves
## inverse from cache if it's already been calculated

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'


}
